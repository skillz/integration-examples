/*!
 @class KVAEvent
 
 @brief The class KVAEvent provides a means of defining a post-install event, providing standardized parameters.
 
 @discussion Sending post-install events is not a requirement.  To track installation information, you do not need to do anything more than call the constructor for the tracker.  Still, many advertisers want to understand and correlate the relationship between conversion and attribution source information with post-install behaviors.  This can only be done by tracking post-install events.
 
 Once the tracker has been configured, Kochava event tracking methods can be called from anywhere within the application.  Events will be coupled with the information sent by the tracker to report events, based on user device and application information.  Events are not sent immediately to Kochava servers but queued, should the device not have connectivity.
 
 The KVAEvent class defines an individual post-install event, providing a variety of standardized event names and parameters.  Standard event names may represent a purchase, the completion of a level, an achievement, etc.  Standard parameters may represent a currency, price, level, etc.
 
 The use of standard event names and parameters maximizes parity with external analytics partners and ensures optimal reporting and analytical output via the Kochava platform.  If the data you are sending through post-install events can be sent using standard event names and parameters we recommend you use an instance of class KVAEvent to do so.

 If the string passed is all numeric (and may include a decimal point), Kochava will automatically sum the amounts passed for the same nameString.  For example, if you sent the purchase amount of in-app purchases in infoString and named nameString âIAP â Purchase Priceâ, Kochava would add up all the purchase amounts for you and present them as a total for âIAP â Purchase Priceâ.  Regardless of what is passed in infoString, Kochavaâs user dashboard will let you access all the data passed in infoString for any nameString, and present a count of all times an event was sent passing any given nameString.
 
 NOTE: If you pass a string of JSON represented data, only the root level (no nested chunks) is stored.  Also, a limit of 75 characters is applied for a non-JSON-decodable string passed as an event infoString.
